This is a software that helps you collect and find prompts.

You can select the prompt that needs to be saved from the web page, click the floating button or the right-click menu option to save it. 
You can also import your favorite prompts through txt files.
Enter letters for fuzzy query when you need to query the prompt.

Tip: You can put prompts with similar functions in the same line of text, which makes it easier to improve efficiency.
